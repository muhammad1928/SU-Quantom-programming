# Quantum Computing Experiments

## Overview
This repository contains quantum computing experiments focusing on quantum arithmetic operations and period finding using Qiskit.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Qiskit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Experiment Structure
- `quantum_arithmetic_tests.py`: Test quantum arithmetic operations
- `period_finding_experiments.py`: Explore period finding algorithms
- `benchmarking.py`: Performance measurement of quantum circuits

## Key Experiments
1. Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
2. Modular Arithmetic Operations
3. Period Finding Algorithm

## Running Experiments
```bash
python period_finding_experiments.py
python quantum_arithmetic_tests.py
```

## Results Interpretation
- Plots in `results/plots/` visualize quantum circuit behaviors
- CSV files in `results/tables/` provide numeric results
- Logs offer detailed execution details

## Limitations
- Experiments run on simulator, not quantum hardware
- Results may vary between runs due to quantum probabilistic nature
